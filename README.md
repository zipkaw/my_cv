# About this document

My own CV on russian language, from LaTeX template.

# Build

I prefer using VS Code [extension](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) with `xelatex` recipe, instead of configuring `make` building.

If u want using the same CV template, but build with `Make`, see how it is completed in my other [repository](https://github.com/zipkaw/diploma/blob/master/main_report/Makefile).
